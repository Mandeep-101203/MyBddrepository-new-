MAVEN-

This project is created by using intellij and git hub and the main purpose of the project is to know how to make and handle projects in company's

Dependencies-

we need to add several depedencies and they are-
>Junit

>Selenium WebDriver

>Cucumber

>Cucumber Junit

*these dependency should be included in POM.XML file


CONNECTIONS-

we have to first establish the connection with github so that we can save our code to the repository

STEPS-

1.The first thing we have to do is create different packages for browser control, features, page objects, step definitions and utilities
(*it should be under this location -src/test/java)

2.We need to create a class under packages for example-under utilities we created 2 classes which called as constantutils & TestRunner.

3.After creating all those classes we have to do some important tasks like-

> we have to select what is supposed to beBASE_URL for the test

> which browser is compatable for the testing

> we have to import all packages in maven which we need during the whole process

4.And finally under feature file we have to create "Test1.feature" file for testing process.
